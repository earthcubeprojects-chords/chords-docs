Workforce diversity in the geosciences can be enhanced by embracing not only science expertise but also engineering,
software, data wrangling and other support areas. Furthermore, bringing climate data sampling to local communities can pique
the interest of a future workforce interested in climate, weather and more broadly science, engineering and technology.
Fortunately, we are in the midst of a revolution of ubiquitous sensor data which is democratizing  data access to an
unprecedented level. The [OpenIoTwx platform](https://git.io/JcRyO), consisting of 3D printed parts as well as very
inexpensive electronic components and sensors, has tremendous potential to bring local weather (and other community) data
to traditionally underserved communities.

Here is an example of a 3D printed weather station![3D-printed weather station](https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/blob/main/img/station-full.jpg)

By embracing the diverse skills needed to construct these IoTwx platforms, placing
them at or near libraries or community colleges in rural communities and making the local weather data easily accessible
through EarthCubeâ€™s Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences (CHORDS) project, we are stimulating interest
in student and citizen science, the geosciences and data-driven community decision making across a wide range of community
partners and stakeholders.

Threats to rural communities are particularly large given increasing climate change impacts, and with both historical
and real-time data often in short supply, decision-making, modeling and planning are rendered ineffective during short-term
crises and trend analysis for medium term planning lacks statistical certainty. Through the collection and access of these
data, an IoTwx station positioned in a local community could enhance understanding of severe weather phenomena and spark
interest in atmospheric science and STEM careers. As part of a small NCAR Diversity grant, we have first partnered with
rural Colorado Community Colleges and are working with STEM educators to engage 2YC students. In the future, we are working
with colleagues to expand this effort to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
