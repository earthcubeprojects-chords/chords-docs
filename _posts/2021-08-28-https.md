title: CHORDS uses https for user security

The internet can be an amazing and wondrous place filled with knowledge and potential. 
However, it can also leave communications and data exposed to potentially damaging intercepts when information is sent over clear-text. 
Which is why the CHORDS team uses https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) for our software instances. 
Since some very low bandwidth systems or systems behind secure firewalls do not need to deal with the extra overhead that secure connections require, users can now choose whether they want their CHORDS portal to encrypt their information over the web or not. 
This feature has been released in version V1.1 and the documentation for configuring https can be found [here](https://earthcubeprojects-chords.github.io/chords-docs/portalconfig/). 
As always, please let us know if you have questions regarding this.
